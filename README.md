# 🗽 NYC 311 Data Pipeline

> A production-grade ELT pipeline that ingests NYC 311 complaint data from the Socrata Open Data API and transforms it into an analytics-ready Snowflake warehouse, orchestrated end-to-end with Airflow.

## 📖 Overview

This project ingests **every NYC 311 service request** — noise complaints, potholes, heat outages, rodent sightings, illegal parking, and 150+ other complaint types — from the city's public API into a fully-modeled Snowflake warehouse. It implements modern data engineering practices end-to-end: medallion architecture, dimensional modeling, incremental builds, SCD Type 2 history tracking, event-driven orchestration, and data contracts.

**One click, full pipeline.** Trigger the extraction DAG in Airflow and the entire chain runs unattended: API → S3 → Snowflake bronze → silver → gold star schema → reporting marts.

## 🏗️ Architecture

## ✨ Features

### 📊 Data Modeling
- **Medallion architecture** — bronze (raw) → silver (cleaned) → gold (analytics-ready)
- **Star schema** in gold — `fct_complaints` joined to conformed dimensions (`dim_borough`, `dim_complaint_type`) via surrogate keys
- **Reporting marts** — pre-aggregated tables for fast BI consumption (`dashboard_daily_summary`)
- **Seeds** — hand-curated reference data for borough metadata and complaint type categorization
- **Unknown sentinel rows** — fact foreign keys are never NULL; missing values route to dimension sentinels (Kimball pattern)

### ⚡ Advanced dbt Patterns
- **Incremental fact table** — `fct_complaints` only processes new rows since last run via MERGE on `complaint_id`
- **SCD Type 2 snapshots** — historical tracking of complaint state transitions (status, closure, agency reassignment) from the bronze source
- **Data contracts** — every mart model declares typed column constraints; build fails on schema drift
- **Custom schema macro** — overrides dbt's default schema naming to land models in BRONZE/SILVER/GOLD directly

### 🧪 Testing & Data Quality
- **40+ data tests** — uniqueness, not-null, referential integrity, accepted values, custom expressions
- **Cross-column invariants** — model-level tests asserting relationships between columns (e.g., `closed_at >= created_at`)
- **Source freshness checks** — defensive monitoring of bronze data staleness
- **Generic + singular tests** — both YAML-declared and SQL-file-defined

### 🪂 Orchestration
- **Event-driven chaining** — extraction DAG produces an Airflow Asset; dbt DAG consumes it (no manual triggers, no polling)
- **TaskGroups** — pipeline organized into visual phases (pre-flight, silver, gold, history)
- **Granular dbt selectors** — each task scopes to a layer for independent re-runs without rebuilding everything
- **Retries with backoff** — transient failures (network, Snowflake throttling) recover automatically
- **Execution timeouts** — prevent runaway queries from blocking the pipeline

### 📐 Production-Grade Engineering
- **Containerized** — entire pipeline runs in Docker via `docker-compose`
- **Secrets management** — credentials sourced from `.env`, injected into containers as environment variables, never committed
- **Version-controlled reference data** — seed CSVs in git, editable via PRs
- **Infrastructure as code** — `docker-compose.yml`, `Dockerfile`, and DAG files fully describe the runtime environment
